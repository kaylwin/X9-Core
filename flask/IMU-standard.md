#Get a standard with Cams&Sensors, then we'll figure out how to make the JSON packaging match on our end.</br>
_push for the standard, we can take it from there_

###This should be the IMU component of the JSON packet sent to the server.

x & y can be pulled from a gamepad joystick</br>
pitch and yaw can be another joystick</br>
z would take 2 buttons (left&right triggers? a&b?)</br>
roll would take 2 buttons (left&right bumpers)</br>


*joysticks should be interchangeable (later)

**pitch should be able to be inverted
