1. Install dependencies with
 sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev imagemagick libv4l-dev

2. create symbolic link of video.h with
 sudo ln -s /usr/include/linux/videodev2.h /usr/include/linux/videodev.h

3. inside mjpg-streamer run
 sudo make
 AND
 sudo make install

4. create environment variable to installed .so files (could insert it into .bashrc):
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/

5. If problems persist, make .so files in /usr/local/lib have all permissions:
 sudo chmod 777 *.so (when in /usr/local/lib/mjpg-streamer/ directory)
