# Semi-set standard for pulling info for IMU packets



x & yaw comes from one joystick
pitch and roll comes from another joystick

+z and -z would be right & left triggers
+y and -y would be right & left bumpers

joysticks can be interchangeable (later)
pitch should be able to be inverted



All IMU properties should be relative, conversion to absolute will happen on the server
